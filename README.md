 # Password Strength Classifier Using Netural Language processing and Logistic Regression.
 
 
The aim of  project to check the Password strength using Logistic Regression machine learning Model. For processing the text data I'll use TF-IDF which is a NLP technique to Preprocess the text data into vectors for machine learning  models. It shows three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong. Strength of the password based on complexity (such as containing digits, special symbols , etc.) .
