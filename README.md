 # Password Strength Classifier Using Netural Language processing and Logistic Regression.
 
 
Passwords are an essential part of system security. it is the more compelling way of authenticating the identity. They provide a simple, direct method of protecting a system and represent an individual's identity for a system. The nature of passwords makes them extremely sensitive. Users are constantly told that a strong password is essential these days to protect private data because there are so many ways for an unauthorized person with little technical knowledge or skill to learn legitimate users' passwords. As a result, it is critical for organizations to identify the vulnerabilities to which passwords are vulnerable and to develop strong policies and controls the creation and use of passwords to ensure that those risks are not manipulated.

The aim of  project to check the Password strength using Logistic Regression machine learning Model. For processing the text data I'll use TF-IDF which is a NLP technique to Preprocess the text data into vectors for machine learning  models. It shows three values(0 , 1 , 2) i.e. 0 for weak, 1 for medium, 2 for strong. Strength of the password based on complexity (such as containing digits, special symbols , etc.) .
